    "synopsis": "For generations, Israel has lived under the shadow of empire—Babylon, Greece, and now Rome. Freedom is no longer a dream; it is a demand.\n\nAs Passover approaches and Jerusalem seethes with unrest, two men stand at the center of a nation's hope. One is Barabbas, a hardened rebel whose violent resistance has made him a symbol of defiance against Roman rule. The other is Jesus of Nazareth, a teacher whose authority stirs crowds but refuses the path of revolution.\n\nWhen the Roman governor offers the people a choice between them, centuries of oppression, memory, and longing converge in a single moment. The crowd chooses the savior it recognizes.\n\nReleased while an innocent man is condemned, Barabbas walks free as the consequences of that decision ripple through Jerusalem and beyond. The Choice is a gripping historical thriller that explores why people choose power over peace, rebellion over redemption—and how history, trauma, and expectation can blind a nation to the salvation standing before it.",
